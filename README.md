# qpp - quant plus plus

## Introduction

A C++ library for option pricing, calibration and risk management.
qpp aims to decouple model specific implementations from the model definitions themselves.

*On one hand, it aims to allow relatively straight forward implementation of new models for quant developers.
*On the other, it aims to be easily usable for quant analysts with working knowledge of c++.
*Finally, it aims to provide a uniform interface to create apps that would use it.

## Requirements

*c++11
*CMake ver. 3.2
